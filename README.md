## About
- Personal collection of Skinning, QoL and Features that i personally want, shared for others to use.
- Still very much learning, so finding flaws will most likely not be impossible:), always open for suggestions and critique.

## Feature List
- Focus Castbar:
    - Focus Castbar that has coloring based on your current kick state with a tick indicator that tells you if kick will be ready for the current cast, newly added so still kinda WIP.
